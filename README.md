# Fitness-Coaching-System
# Systematic Fitness Coaching System

## Overview
Designed a science-based fitness coaching system for personalized routine design, client coaching, and progress tracking, optimized for remote delivery. Leveraged periodization, progressive overload, and heart rate zones to achieve outcomes like a client gaining 7 kg of muscle in 7 months. Includes shareable templates for workout plans and progress tracking.

## Key Features
- **Routine Design**: Developed routines for swimming, cycling, strength training, and running using scientific frameworks (periodization, progressive overload, heart rate zones).
- **Custom Coaching**: Created individualized programs based on client goals (e.g., muscle gain: 5–8 reps, compound lifts, calorie surplus; weight loss: calorie deficit, 12–15 reps; endurance: 12–20 reps; flexibility: yoga).
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitored metrics (e.g., weight, performance) via Excel and Google Sheets, optimizing programs for effectiveness.
- **Remote Scalability**: Delivered coaching via Zoom and Google Suite (Docs, Sheets, Keep) for async communication and documentation.
- **Proprietary Templates**: Built custom templates for clients to simplify program adherence, based on fitness science (see `/templates`).

## Key Outcomes
- Client gained 7 kg of muscle (55 kg to 62 kg) in 7 months through structured strength training and calorie surplus (~1 kg/month).
- Supported clients in weight loss, endurance, and flexibility goals (e.g., ~5–10% body fat reduction, 10–20% flexibility improvement; specific metrics pending).
- Established a scalable, remote-first coaching methodology.

## Shareable Assets
- `/templates/workout-plan.md`: Sample 4-week strength training plan for muscle gain.
- `/templates/progress-tracker.xlsx`: Sample Excel sheet for tracking weight and performance.
- See `/templates` for more resources.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Systems Thinking: Designed structured, repeatable fitness programs.
- Problem-Solving: Tailored solutions to diverse client needs.
- Data-Driven Optimization: Used Excel/Google Sheets for progress tracking and adjustments.
- Communication: Delivered clear coaching via Zoom and async tools.
- Research Application: Applied fitness science (e.g., Schoenfeld et al., 2019) to program design.

## Tools & Technologies
- Excel, Google Suite (Docs, Sheets, Keep), Zoom.
- Previously used 5/3/1 Strongman software for strength programming.

## Potential Applications
- Scalable for remote fitness platforms or wellness startups.
- Applicable to roles in process design, client success, or operations in remote-first companies.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate fitness APIs (e.g., Strava, MyFitnessPal) for automated tracking.
- Develop a web-based client dashboard for real-time progress visualization.
